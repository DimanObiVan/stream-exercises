#Java 8 Stream Exercises

Fix `BookFinder.java` so that `exercise1()` returns the unique surnames, in uppercase of the first 5 authors that are 50 years or older.

Then fix `BookFinder.java` so that `exercise2()` returns `the sum of all ages of all female authors under 25`

`BookFinderTest.java` contains automated tests for both scenarios to help you check your work.

Solutions to both exercises are available on the `solution` branch
